Second Computer Architecture project : x86 assembly + C++ binary turtle graphics

The objective was to create a simple program that draws colored lines according to the instructions provided in a binary file. The "turtle" drawing the images can:
	1. "teleport" to designated coordinates
	2. set its direction to up/down/left/right
	3. move a positive number of pixels in the direction it is facing
	4. raise / lower its "pen" and set its color to one of 8 predefined values
	(moving forwards while the "pen" is lowered will draw a straight line from the turtle's start position to the end position)

The "testing" of the program consisted of providing input files, output file and describing the sequence of procedures that have taken place to receive the output file.
The program draws fixed size images
